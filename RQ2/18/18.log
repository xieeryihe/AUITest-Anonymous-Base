  "description": "The page from the commercial platform mobile app appears to be a typical social media interface with various navigation and interaction elements. At the top, there are icons for 'Search' and 'Messaging' features. Just below these, there's a prominent 'Facebook' logo. The main body of the page is segmented into various sections - likely for different kinds of content or functionalities. These sections include options to go to the user's profile, make a post, share photos or videos, and create a story. The page also includes elements to remove content and interact with others' profiles through options like 'Add as a friend'. Several profile pictures and names are shown, indicating a social feed or friends' updates. Towards the bottom, the page mentions locations and statuses, hinting at social posts from users. Overall, the page combines search, messaging, profile management, content creation, and social interaction capabilities, serving as a comprehensive interface for user engagement."

2024-10-27 13:56:21 - 2024-10-27 13:56:21 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "Edit your personal bio to "Hello Sky", and save the changes.". 
            The user have drawn 38 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID9: widget description:Navigates to the user profile, widget function:Button
        2. Widget with ID10: widget description:Allows user to input text to create a post, widget function:Text field

2024-10-27 13:56:21 - 2024-10-27 13:56:21 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Click on the 'Go to profile' button to navigate to the user's profile.".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:
                {"Declare the function you're calling, strictly adhere to its format."}

You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.

The profile page displayed icons representing 'Home', 'Video', 'Groups', 'Profile', 'Notification bell', and 'Menu', which were non-clickable.\n3. Specific buttons related to profile management appeared, including 'Edit profile' (clickable), 'Profile switcher' (clickable), 'Add cover photo' (clickable), 'Edit profile picture' (clickable), 'Edit cover photo' (clickable), and 'Add to story' (clickable).\n4. Text elements such as 'FeixingLuan', '1', 'People you may know', and abbreviated profile names like 'Muhammad I..' and 'Official Nana..' appeared to indicate different sections and user identifications.\n5. The main action involved editing the bio section, which was not explicitly detailed in the provided UI Widgets description but would have involved clicking on the 'Edit profile' button, updating the text to 'Hello Sky', and saving the changes.\n\nOverall, the action summary highlights the navigation from the main page to the profile page and subsequent display of profile-specific management options, including editing and updating the personal bio."}}]

Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface.

            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.

            The user have drawn 13 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:Button to navigate back to the previous screen., widget function:Navigation
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:Non-interactive title indicating the section for editing the profile., widget function:Title
        3. Widget with ID2: widget description:Button to add or edit the profile picture., widget function:Add Button
        4. Widget with ID3: widget description:Non-interactive text labeling the profile picture section., widget function:Label
        5. Widget with ID4: widget description:Current profile picture, likely clickable to edit it., widget function:Profile Picture
        6. Widget with ID5: widget description:Non-interactive text labeling the avatar section., widget function:Label
        7. Widget with ID6: widget description:Image representing the user's avatar., widget function:Avatar Image
        8. Widget with ID7: widget description:Non-interactive instructional text about creating an avatar., widget function:Instruction
        9. Widget with ID8: widget description:Continuation of the instructional text about creating an avatar., widget function:Instruction
        10. Widget with ID9: widget description:Button to create an avatar and display it on the profile., widget function:Action Button
        11. Widget with ID10: widget description:Button to add or edit the profile picture., widget function:Add Button
        12. Widget with ID11: widget description:Non-interactive text labeling the cover photo section., widget function:Label
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:

2024-10-27 13:56:21 - 2024-10-27 13:56:21 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Identify the bio text field on the profile editing page and click on it to make it editable.".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:

2024-10-27 13:56:21 - 2024-10-27 13:56:21 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "Edit your personal bio to "Hello Sky", and save the changes.". 
            The user have drawn 13 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:Button to navigate back to the previous screen., widget function:Navigation
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:Non-interactive title indicating the section for editing the profile., widget function:Title
        3. Widget with ID2: widget description:Button to add or edit the profile picture., widget function:Add Button
        4. Widget with ID3: widget description:Non-interactive text labeling the profile picture section., widget function:Label
        5. Widget with ID4: widget description:Current profile picture, likely clickable to edit it., widget function:Profile Picture
        6. Widget with ID5: widget description:Non-interactive text labeling the avatar section., widget function:Label
        7. Widget with ID6: widget description:Image representing the user's avatar., widget function:Avatar Image
        8. Widget with ID7: widget description:Non-interactive instructional text about creating an avatar., widget function:Instruction
        9. Widget with ID8: widget description:Continuation of the instructional text about creating an avatar., widget function:Instruction
        10. Widget with ID9: widget description:Button to create an avatar and display it on the profile., widget function:Action Button
        11. Widget with ID10: widget description:Button to add or edit the profile picture., widget function:Add Button
        12. Widget with ID11: widget description:Non-interactive text labeling the cover photo section., widget function:Label
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:

Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}

            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.

2024-10-27 13:56:21 - 2024-10-27 13:56:21 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "Edit your personal bio to "Hello Sky", and save the changes.". 
            The user have drawn 22 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.

Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.\n            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                \n            \n            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:\n                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you\'re clicking this"}\n                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}\n                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you\'re long clicking this"}\n                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}\n                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}\n                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}\n                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you\'re deleting text in this field"}\n            \n            Note: \n                1. You should call one function per response.\n                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the \'target\' field\n                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).\n                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.\n                \n                \n            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:\n                {"Declare the function you\'re calling, strictly adhere to its format."}\n        '}]}

2024-10-27 13:56:45 - 2024-10-27 13:56:45 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "Edit your personal bio to "Hello Sky", and save the changes.". 
            The user have drawn 23 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:

2024-10-27 13:57:06 - 2024-10-27 13:57:06 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "Edit your personal bio to "Hello Sky", and save the changes.". 
            The user have drawn 20 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:
            {"0": {"text": "Back", "function": "", "description": ""}, "1": {"text": "Editbio", "function": "", "description": ""}, "2": {"text": "Save", "function": "", "description": ""}, "3": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "4": {"text": "Feixing", "function": "", "description": ""}, "5": {"text": "Luan", "function": "", "description": ""}, "6": {"text": "Public", "function": "", "description": ""}, "7": {"text": "add", "function": "", "description": ""}, "8": {"text": "shorta", "function": "", "description": ""}, "9": {"text": "biototellpeoplemoreabout", "function": "", "description": ""}, "10": {"text": "You", "function": "", "description": ""}, "11": {"text": "can", "function": "", "description": ""}, "12": {"text": "This", "function": "", "description": ""}, "13": {"text": "yourself.", "function": "", "description": ""}, "14": {"text": "couldbeanythinglikeafavorite", "function": "", "description": ""}, "15": {"text": "whator", "function": "", "description": ""}, "16": {"text": "makesyouhappy", "function": "", "description": ""}, "17": {"text": "quote", "function": "", "description": ""}, "18": {"text": "1", "function": "", "description": ""}, "19": {"text": "1/101", "function": "", "description": ""}}

2024-10-27 13:57:06 - 2024-10-27 13:57:06 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Identify the bio text field, make it editable if necessary, enter 'Hello Sky' as the new bio text, and then click the 'Save' button to save the changes.".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.

2024-10-27 13:57:06 - 2024-10-27 13:57:06 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "Edit your personal bio to "Hello Sky", and save the changes.". 
            The user have drawn 22 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.

2024-10-27 13:57:06 - 2024-10-27 13:57:06 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Click on the 'Edit' button next to the 'Bio' section to make the bio text field editable.".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:
                {"Declare the function you're calling, strictly adhere to its format."}
