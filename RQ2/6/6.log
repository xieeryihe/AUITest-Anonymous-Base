2024-10-25 16:12:12 - 2024-10-25 16:12:12 - You are a front-end testing engineer, and you have received a set of interaction instructions. You need to group the current interaction instructions to guide the subsequent operations.

            <Current Interaction Instructions>
            遍历第一到四条推文
            </Current Interaction Instructions>

            Examples:
            1.上划一次，遍历底部tab栏，上划直到找到预约按钮，点击预约按钮. Grouped as: ["上划一次", "遍历底部tab栏", "上划直到找到预约按钮", "点击预约按钮"]
            2.预定肯德基汉堡套餐. Grouped as: ["预定肯德基汉堡套餐"]
            3.点击预约按钮，点击添加游玩人，输入身份证，输入手机号，点击右下角的提交预约按钮. Grouped as: ["点击添加游玩人", "输入身份证", "输入手机号", "点击右下角的提交预约按钮"]
            
            
            Splitting Rules:
            1. Please do not arbitrarily decompose tasks.
            2. Requirements that belong to the same interaction task should not be split into different groups.
            3. For logic branch tasks, please group them together.
            
            Return a list with json format like: {"tasks": ["group1", "group2", "group3", ...]}

2024-10-25 16:12:45 - 2024-10-25 16:12:45 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 35 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:
            {"0": {"text": "菜单三", "function": "", "description": ""}, "1": {"text": "搜索", "function": "", "description": ""}, "2": {"text": "关注", "function": "", "description": ""}, "3": {"text": "发现", "function": "", "description": ""}, "4": {"text": "附近", "function": "", "description": ""}, "5": {"text": "已选定推荐", "function": "", "description": ""}, "6": {"text": "视频", "function": "", "description": ""}, "7": {"text": "直播", "function": "", "description": ""}, "8": {"text": "科技数码", "function": "", "description": ""}, "9": {"text": "科学科普", "function": "", "description": ""}, "10": {"text": "美食", "function": "", "description": ""}, "11": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "12": {"text": "小红书跟风最成功的一次", "function": "", "description": ""}, "13": {"text": "上海我心中排名No.1的披", "function": "", "description": ""}, "14": {"text": "(北外滩不绕路攻略", "function": "", "description": ""}, "15": {"text": "萨！！私心不想分享...", "function": "", "description": ""}, "16": {"text": "1821", "function": "", "description": ""}, "17": {"text": "139", "function": "", "description": ""}, "18": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "19": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "20": {"text": "Kitty姐", "function": "", "description": ""}, "21": {"text": "沐禾悦悦", "function": "", "description": ""}, "22": {"text": "这就是我买iphone16的", "function": "", "description": ""}, "23": {"text": "家门口的秋天就很美了", "function": "", "description": ""}, "24": {"text": "意义...", "function": "", "description": ""}, "25": {"text": "(无滤镜)", "function": "", "description": ""}, "26": {"text": "么么灵4984", "function": "", "description": ""}, "27": {"text": "4984", "function": "", "description": ""}, "28": {"text": "syeadbb2.0万", "function": "", "description": ""}, "29": {"text": "2.0万", "function": "", "description": ""}, "30": {"text": "首页", "function": "", "description": ""}, "31": {"text": "购物", "function": "", "description": ""}, "32": {"text": "发布", "function": "", "description": ""}, "33": {"text": "消息，1条未读消息1", "function": "", "description": ""}, "34": {"text": "我", "function": "", "description": ""}}

2024-10-25 16:12:45 - 2024-10-25 16:12:45 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Start by inspecting the first tweet on the current UI page. Observe and document the details, such as title ('小红书跟风最成功的一次'), subtitle ('(北外滩不绕路攻略)'), username ('沐禾悦悦'), and like count ('1821').".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:

            The user have drawn 14 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:非选中状态的分享按钮, widget function:分享按钮
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:非选中状态的返回按钮, widget function:返回按钮
        3. Widget with ID10: widget description:显示点赞数为2009的按钮，非选中状态, widget function:点赞按钮
        4. Widget with ID11: widget description:显示收藏数为1098的按钮，非选中状态, widget function:收藏按钮
        5. Widget with ID12: widget description:显示评论数为131的按钮，非选中状态, widget function:评论按钮
        6. Widget with ID13: widget description:未输入文本的评论输入框，提示用户发表评论, widget function:评论输入框
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:
            {"0": {"text": "分享", "function": "", "description": ""}, "1": {"text": "返回", "function": "", "description": ""}, "2": {"text": "关注", "function": "", "description": ""}, "3": {"text": "沐禾悦悦", "function": "", "description": ""}, "4": {"text": "小红书跟风最成功的一次(北外滩不绕路攻略", "function": "", "description": ""}, "5": {"text": "近期的上海简直是人间理想", "function": "", "description": ""}, "6": {"text": "晴天傍晚来吹吹北外滩的风", "function": "", "description": ""}, "7": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "8": {"text": "国庆别去外滩人挤人啦！！来这里~", "function": "", "description": ""}, "9": {"text": "#一个人出去玩#上海旅游攻略#北外滩快速进入攻", "function": "", "description": ""}, "10": {"text": "点赞1823", "function": "", "description": ""}, "11": {"text": "收藏2152", "function": "", "description": ""}, "12": {"text": "评论44", "function": "", "description": ""}, "13": {"text": "评论框说点什么...", "function": "", "description": ""}}

Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 35 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:Icon representing the main menu, non-clickable., widget function:menu
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:Icon representing search functionality, clickable., widget function:search
        3. Widget with ID3: widget description:Tab for discovering new content, clickable, selected., widget function:explore
        4. Widget with ID4: widget description:Tab for nearby content, clickable, not selected., widget function:nearby
        5. Widget with ID5: widget description:Tab for recommended content, clickable, not selected., widget function:recommend
        6. Widget with ID17: widget description:Displays the number of likes (562) for a post, non-clickable., widget function:likeCount
        7. Widget with ID32: widget description:Button to create a new post, clickable., widget function:post
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Click on the second tweet to inspect and document its details (title: '上海我心中排名No.1的披', subtitle: '萨！！私心不想分享...', username: 'Kitty姐', like count: '139').".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:
                {"Declare the function you're calling, strictly adhere to its format."}

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 14 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:
            {"0": {"text": "分享", "function": "", "description": ""}, "1": {"text": "返回", "function": "", "description": ""}, "2": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "3": {"text": "关注", "function": "", "description": ""}, "4": {"text": "Kitty姐", "function": "", "description": ""}, "5": {"text": "上海我心中排名No.1的披萨！！私心不想分享..", "function": "", "description": ""}, "6": {"text": "这家餐厅我心中排名第一好吃的！！", "function": "", "description": ""}, "7": {"text": "不愧是连续7年米其林推荐...招牌布拉塔黑松露披萨一", "function": "", "description": ""}, "8": {"text": "生推！！", "function": "", "description": ""}, "9": {"text": "现抛黑松露十咸蛋黄，再十橄榄油，现烤的饼皮我超", "function": "", "description": ""}, "10": {"text": "点赞139", "function": "", "description": ""}, "11": {"text": "收藏92", "function": "", "description": ""}, "12": {"text": "评论21", "function": "", "description": ""}, "13": {"text": "评论框说点什么...", "function": "", "description": ""}}

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Click the '返回' (return) button to navigate back to the main tweets feed page.".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:
                {"Declare the function you're calling, strictly adhere to its format."}

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 35 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:Icon representing the main menu, non-clickable., widget function:menu
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:Icon representing search functionality, clickable., widget function:search
        3. Widget with ID3: widget description:Tab for discovering new content, clickable, selected., widget function:explore
        4. Widget with ID4: widget description:Tab for nearby content, clickable, not selected., widget function:nearby
        5. Widget with ID5: widget description:Tab for recommended content, clickable, not selected., widget function:recommend
        6. Widget with ID17: widget description:Displays the number of likes (562) for a post, non-clickable., widget function:likeCount
        7. Widget with ID32: widget description:Button to create a new post, clickable., widget function:post
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:

This pattern will be repeated for the third and fourth tweets until all necessary details are appropriately documented.", 'action': "Click the '返回' (return) button to navigate back to the main tweets feed page."}
2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Click the '返回' (return) button to navigate back to the main tweets feed page.".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:
                {"Declare the function you're calling, strictly adhere to its format."}

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 35 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:Icon representing the main menu, non-clickable., widget function:menu
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:Icon representing search functionality, clickable., widget function:search
        3. Widget with ID3: widget description:Tab for discovering new content, clickable, selected., widget function:explore
        4. Widget with ID4: widget description:Tab for nearby content, clickable, not selected., widget function:nearby
        5. Widget with ID5: widget description:Tab for recommended content, clickable, not selected., widget function:recommend
        6. Widget with ID17: widget description:Displays the number of likes (562) for a post, non-clickable., widget function:likeCount
        7. Widget with ID32: widget description:Button to create a new post, clickable., widget function:post
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:

Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}

                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:

Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.\n            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                \n            \n            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:\n                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area.

2024-10-25 16:14:36 - 2024-10-25 16:14:36 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 14 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:
                1. Ensure the description accounts for the widget's current status and appearance within the image.
                2. The action required to fulfill this task involves combining visual analysis with the provided textual information to complete the description of each widget's function.
                
                
            Additional widget information: use the following information to help your task.
            1. Widget with ID0: widget description:This is a share button, currently selected., widget function:Share Button
        2. Widget with ID1: widget description:This is a back button used to return to the previous screen., widget function:Back Button
        3. Widget with ID2: widget description:This button allows the user to follow the profile., widget function:Follow Button
                
            Note: Focus your analysis strictly within the widgets' rectangular boundaries. After completing your descriptions, return only the filled-in information without including any additional comments or instructions.
            Fill in the general function of each widget below, response the filled result in json format:
            {"0": {"text": "分享", "function": "", "description": ""}, "1": {"text": "返回", "function": "", "description": ""}, "2": {"text": "关注", "function": "", "description": ""}, "3": {"text": "", "function": "", "description": ""}, "4": {"text": "Kitty姐", "function": "", "description": ""}, "5": {"text": "上海我心中排名No.1的披萨！！私心不想分享..", "function": "", "description": ""}, "6": {"text": "这家餐厅我心中排名第一好吃的！！", "function": "", "description": ""}, "7": {"text": "不愧是连续7年米其林推荐...招牌布拉塔黑松露披萨一", "function": "", "description": ""}, "8": {"text": "生推！！", "function": "", "description": ""}, "9": {"text": "现抛黑松露十咸蛋黄，再十橄榄油，现烤的饼皮我超", "function": "", "description": ""}, "10": {"text": "点赞139", "function": "", "description": ""}, "11": {"text": "收藏92", "function": "", "description": ""}, "12": {"text": "评论21", "function": "", "description": ""}, "13": {"text": "评论框说点什么...", "function": "", "description": ""}}

2024-10-25 16:15:34 - 2024-10-25 16:15:34 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Inspect and document the details of the second tweet, focusing on the title ('上海我心中排名No.1的披萨！！私心不想分享..'), username ('Kitty姐'), and like count ('点赞139').".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:

2024-10-25 16:16:18 - 2024-10-25 16:16:18 - The user is using a comprehensive commercial platform app on a smartphone, and the user's target is "遍历第一到四条推文". 
            The user have drawn 14 rectangles on an image to highlight different widgets of the app.             Each rectangle, marked with a numeric ID in the upper left corner, encompasses a widget.
        
            For each widget, the user will provide text information in Chinese, which will serve as supplementary data to help determine the function of each widget.             You are tasked with analyzing the visual and textual information to describe the general function of each widget, paying close attention to its type(e.g., button, icon, image, textline, etc.) and status(e.g., selected, not selected, typed text, placeholder, non-interactive, non-clickable).
        
            When describing a widget, focus primarily on its visual representation within the rectangular boundary and use the provided text information as auxiliary.             If a widget lacks text information, it likely functions as an icon or an image. Your descriptions should encapsulate both the displayed content and the inferred function of each widget.
        
            Instructions:

2024-10-25 16:16:22 - 2024-10-25 16:16:22 - You are programmed to interact with a smartphone app to accomplish a specific task outlined as "Inspect and document the details of the second tweet, focusing on the title ('上海我心中排名No.1的披萨！！私心不想分享..'), username ('Kitty姐'), and like count ('点赞139').".             Your capabilities include clicking on items, wait for a specific time, typing text, long-clicking on widgets, scrolling through content and delete texts.
            Some widgets contain a "next_page" field that provides information about the page path that appears after clicking this widget. You can use this information to make decisions.                
            
            Your Task: Complete the specific task by strategically calling one of the following functions:
                1. click: Used to click a widget or a specific screen area. Format: {"action": "click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're clicking this"}
                2. type: Call this function to enter text into a field, the target should be an input field, observe the image carefully. Format: {"action": "type", "target": "ID of the field", "text": "text to enter", "reason": "why this text is needed"}
                3. long_click: To perform a longer press on a widget. Format: {"action": "long_click", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're long clicking this"}
                4. swipe to scroll up/down one screen: This action moves the view up or down by one screen height, allowing you to scroll through content. Format: {"action": "scroll", "direction": "[up, down]", "reason": "why scrolling is necessary"}
                5. swipe from a specific element/region to move up/down/left/right: This action involves starting the swipe gesture from a specified element or region, and moving in the desired direction, to navigate or interact with specific parts of the interface. Format: {"action": "swipe", "target": "widget ID or description of the target screen area", "direction": "[up, down, right, left]", "distance": "[long, medium, short]", "reason": "why swiping is necessary"}
                6. wait: To wait for a specific time. Format: {"action": "wait", "time": "time to wait in seconds"}
                7. delete: To delete text in a field. Format: {"action": "delete", "target": "widget ID or description of the target", "reason": "why you're deleting text in this field"}
            
            Note: 
                1. You should call one function per response.
                2. You should prioritize using the widget ID in the 'target' field
                3. If you need to type text, call the "type" function directly, do not call "click" function before typing(You do not need to click on the field to activate it or bring up the keyboard).
                4. The page may contain multiple widgets with the same function, in this case: pay attention to the location of the target described in the task, find the target in the screenshot and determine which widget is the target.
                
                
            Response Format, your response should be in this json format:
