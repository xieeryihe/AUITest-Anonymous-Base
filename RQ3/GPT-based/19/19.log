2024-10-30 10:19:45 - 2024-10-30 10:19:45 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "Check whether the rating of the online marketplace app is consistent on the chart page and its detail page", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}

As an experienced tester, your test task is "Check whether the rating of the online marketplace app is consistent on the chart page and its detail page", you can analyze the user's navigation and interaction records to fulfill the test task.         Your analysis should be based on the records, which documents the pages visited and observations made by the user throughout their session, the information stream is:
            
    Page 0: {"Page Type": "This page appears to be an app discovery or recommendation page within the platform, showcasing various apps along with their details and ratings.", "Widget Amazon Shopping widget": "The widget displays the Amazon Shopping app, an online marketplace. It includes the app's name, a summary indicating it is a shopping and online marketplace app, and the app's rating of 4.5 stars. 应用的评分: 4.5"}

    Page 1: {"Page Type": "Top charts page showing rankings and ratings of popular apps", "Widget rating widget": "The widget displays the 应用的评分 as '4.4' next to a dark-colored star icon."}
    Action 1: Inspect the list of apps shown in the 'Top charts' section and identify if any of these fall under the category of an online marketplace. As none are clearly indicated as such right now, and given that we need to complete the task of exploring an online marketplace app, I'll proceed with selecting 'TikTok' as an initial step. Click on the row corresponding to 'TikTok', which is the first item in the 'Top charts'. This will lead to the detailed view of the TikTok app.
    Page 2: {"Page Type": "App detail page displaying description, ratings, and installation options", "Widget average rating widget": "The widget shows the application's average rating as 4.2 stars based on 19 million reviews (19M reviews)."}
    Action 2: Tap on the 'Navigate up' button to go back to the 'Top charts' section. This is because I need to return to the top charts in order to locate the first online marketplace app.
    Page 3: {"Page Type": "Top charts page displaying ranked apps.", "Widget rating widget": "The widget is displaying the application's rating as 4.4 and includes a star icon."}
    Action 3: Inspect the list of displayed apps to identify if any of them are online marketplace apps. Specifically, check the category text and app names in the visible list.
    Page 4: {"Page Type": "This page appears to be a chart page that lists various apps along with their ratings, names, categories, and rankings within an online marketplace.", "Widget rating widget": "The widget displays the 应用的评分 as 4.6, accompanied by a star icon to indicate the rating."}
    Action 4: Scroll down in the 'Top charts' section to locate the 'Shopee: Shop and Get Cashback' app, and then click on the row corresponding to this app to view its details.
    Page 5: {"Page Type": "App detail page showing information like app rating, reviews, installation options, screenshots, and features.", "Widget Average rating widget": "The widget displays the 应用的评分 as 4.6 stars based on 189K reviews. It shows '4.6★' followed by '189K reviews'."}
