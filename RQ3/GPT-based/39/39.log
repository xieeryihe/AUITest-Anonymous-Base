2024-10-30 19:49:56 - 2024-10-30 19:49:56 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "Check whether the introduction and name of the user who posted the first tweet are consistent before and after clicking", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}
