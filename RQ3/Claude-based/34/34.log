2024-10-31 14:38:28 - 2024-10-31 14:38:28 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "检查是否成功选择运动类别为网球", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}

2024-10-31 14:39:56 - 2024-10-31 14:39:56 - {"judgement": "No", "reason": "Based on the provided information and images, the test task of successfully selecting tennis ('网球') as the sport category was not completed. The user navigated through several screens and reached the sport selection page, but there is no evidence that tennis was actually selected. In the final image showing the list of sports, tennis ('网球') is visible as an option, but its checkbox is not marked as selected. The navigation ended at this screen without any indication of the user tapping on the tennis option or confirming the selection. Therefore, the task of checking whether tennis was successfully selected as the sport category cannot be confirmed as completed."}
