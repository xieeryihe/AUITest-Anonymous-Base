2024-10-31 13:34:00 - 2024-10-31 13:34:00 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "检查点击收藏按钮后，按钮是否变黄，收藏数是否加1", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}

After clicking the favorite button (Action 1), we see in Page 2 that: a) The favorite button has changed color. It's described as a 'yellow star icon', confirming that the button has turned yellow. b) The favorite count is now 49, which is an increase of 1 from the previous count of 48. These observations directly fulfill the requirements of the test task. The favorite button has changed color to yellow, and the favorite count has increased by 1 after the click action. Therefore, the functionality appears to be working as expected."}
