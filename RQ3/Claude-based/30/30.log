2024-10-31 14:32:59 - 2024-10-31 14:32:59 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "检查点赞后，点赞按钮是否变红，点赞数是否增加1", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}

Although the number of likes increased by 1, the button's color changed to blue instead of the expected red. Specifically: 1. On Page 3, before the like action, the like button was described as a 'heart-shaped outline icon in light gray color' with '66' likes. 2. After the user clicked the like icon (Action 3), Page 4 shows that the like button changed to a 'blue heart-shaped icon', whereas it was expected to turn red. 3. The number of likes did increase from 66 to 67, meeting part of the test task requirement. These observations confirm that while the number of likes increased as expected, the button color change did not meet the specified conditions of the test task."}
