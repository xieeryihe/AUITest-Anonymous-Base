2024-10-31 14:44:23 - 2024-10-31 14:44:23 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "Check whether the email is successfully sent", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}

As an experienced tester, your test task is "Check whether the email is successfully sent", you can analyze the user's navigation and interaction records to fulfill the test task.         Your analysis should be based on the records, which documents the pages visited and observations made by the user throughout their session, the information stream is:
            
    Page 0: {"Page Type": "This is the inbox page of an email application, displaying a list of received emails.", "Page Information": {"发送邮件的状态": ["invisible"]}}
    Action 0: Click on the 'Compose' button to start a new email draft.
    Page 1: {"Page Type": "This is an email composition page within an email application, allowing users to create and send new emails.", "Page Information": {"发送邮件的状态": ["invisible"]}}
    Action 1: Click on the 'To' textline to enter the recipient's email address 'xieeryihe0@gmail.com'.
    Page 2: {"Page Type": "This is an email composition page within an email application, showing fields for sender, recipient, and a keyboard for typing the message.", "Page Information": {"发送邮件的状态": ["invisible"]}}
    Action 2: Click on the 'Send' button to send the empty email. This button is identified by its text 'Send' and corresponds to executing the intent of sending the composed email.
    Page 3: {"Page Type": "This is an email composition page within an email application, showing fields for sender, recipient, and a keyboard for typing the message.", "Page Information": {"发送邮件的状态": ["invisible"]}}

The test task was to check whether the email is successfully sent, but there are several issues: 1. In the navigation records, after clicking the 'Send' button (Action 2), the user remains on the email composition page (Page 3). There is no indication of a successful send or a transition to a sent confirmation page. 2. The '发送邮件的状态' (email sending status) remains 'invisible' throughout all pages, suggesting no change in the sending status. 3. In the images provided, we can see the email composition interface, but there's no visual feedback or confirmation that the email was sent after the 'Send' action was supposed to have occurred. 4. The last image still shows the email composition page with the 'Next' button visible, indicating that the sending process was not completed. These observations suggest that the email sending process was not successful or at least not properly confirmed to the user. For a successful test, we would expect to see either a confirmation message, a return to the inbox, or some other clear indication that the email was sent."}
