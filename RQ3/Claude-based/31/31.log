2024-10-31 14:34:30 - 2024-10-31 14:34:30 - A comprehensive commercial platform's mobile app is currently undergoing testing. The user is tasked with extracting specific information from a screenshot of the app.             As an experienced tester, your role is to identify the target information the user aims to extract based on the user's test oracle. 
            
            Note: do not include the index or type of the page in your answer, such as: 'xxx of the first/second/third page', 'xxx on the product list/detail page', generalize the target information you need to describe in this way.
            For instance:
                if the test oracle is "Check that the like button is white before liking, and red after liking.", the target information should be ['The color of the like button'], instead of ['The color of the like button before liking', 'The color of the like button after liking'].
                if the test oracle is "Verify whether the price of hamburger on the product list page and the product details page is consistent.", the target information should be ['The price of hamburger'], instead of ['The price of hamburger on product list page', 'The price of hamburger on product detail page'].
            
            Given the user's test oracle: "检查是否成功进入《明朝那些事》的书籍详情页", your response should be in Chinese and structured in json format as follows: {'target': ['name of the first target information', ...]}
